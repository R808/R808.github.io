GAME PLAN

This game is aimed for PC and is a strategy game.

At the start of the game there will be a title screen and a menu so that you can choose your squad (first time playing) or buy more troops, play the game with the start game button. The start of the game will be a background image and have three sprites on it (menu, start game and leader board).

 You can deploy troops on your side of the map and a random dice will roll for your movement i.e. if the two die rolled 3,5 you would move 8 paces you could then shoot. You can shoot the whole length of the board and only at the other team ( computer troops). On  the computers turn it will not move but will shoot once for each of their troops.

It will be a sandbox game and have no levels much like space invaders. If you win a game you get coins to buy different troops. It is based on warhammer so will have troops from the game. At the very start of the whole game NOT at the start of each battle you can pick your warhammer troop i.e. space marines, dark angels or orks.you can also pick a name although this will not affect the game.

There will be music during the game different for the battle and the menu screen. When a troop shoots the end of the barrel will light up and make a sound.
