    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had an initial plan listing all the things we needed to make and every aspect of the game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start making our game and finish an initial starting platform - start button, instructions, leader board etc.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I finished most of it in the lesson but completed anything that was not finished at home.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I couldn't code the start button to work and take you to the game screen but eventually after reading through my code I worked out the problem and fixed it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>How could you add an automatically updating leaderboard?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I didn’t ask for help instead I worked out my own coding problems and fixed them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could have got more done in the lesson so I had less homework and in the lessons to come i could have focused more on the design of the game rather than the basic building blocks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I used my plan carefully and asked interesting and challenging questions about different aspects of the game that could have improved my overall mark and complexness of the game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have got more done in the lesson so I didn’t have as much homework to do and also i should have stuck to my plan more so I didn’t waste time on doing other unessential things.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Stick to my plan and research what i need to do so i know how to do it (quickly) and don’t waste time.</td>
